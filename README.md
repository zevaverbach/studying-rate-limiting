This repository contains my implementations and explorations of rate limiting, drawn initially from the book _System Design Interview_.

I'm embarking on this in order to get a great software engineering (probably back-end) job, and at the moment I have Happy Scribe in mind since I have an interview with them on August 24th, directly after our family vacation in Greece.

Over a year ago (early 2022) I did a job search, and some of the interview processes ended right before or after the system design phase, so it's obviously something I need in my portfolio to truly be considered for senior dev roles. While I'd love to get a job as a junior or mid-level, my salary requirements and age (45) push me towards senior. That, and maybe the fact that I'm a decent programmer by now.
